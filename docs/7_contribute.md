# Contribute to This Website

To contribute to this website, we provide two ways:

- via a Pull Request

## Contribute via an Issue

If you want to add or fix something, feel free to open up an issue, and we will handle it ASAP.

## Contribute via a Pull Request (Recommended)

If you want to edit the content in person, you can fork the latest version, submit your modification, and use a pull request to merge. When you are editing the project on your device, here are some instructions for you.

Modifications for our websites take place in the `dev` branch, which will be used to update the `main` branch periodically. Also, you can share your supplementary code and assets on the`code` and link them on the website.

### Hand-On Docusaurus Locally

The project is built with Docusaurus, a static website generator for documentations. You need to follow [this page](https://docusaurus.io/zh-CN/docs/installation) to install it on your device, and also follow [this tutorial](https://docusaurus.io/zh-CN/docs/category/guides) to know how to write the documents.

### Check Your Contribution

After modifying the code, remember to use `npm run build` to check the compilation, and use `npm run start` to check the compiled website. Once you think your modification is ready, you can commit your code.

### Merge Your Code

After committing your code to your forked repo, you can start a pull request for merging it into our repo. Note that all the changes on the website should be merged into the `dev` branch first. For supplementary codes and assets, you can merge the commit into the `code` branch.
