- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08686)

### DexPBT
DexPBT implements challenging tasks for one- or two-armed robots equipped with multi-fingered hand end-effectors, including regrasping, grasp-and-throw, and object reorientation. It also introduces a decentralized Population-Based Training (PBT) algorithm that massively amplifies the exploration capabilities of deep reinforcement learning.

### TimeChamber
TimeChamber is a large scale self-play framework running on parallel simulation. Running self-play algorithms always need lots of hardware resources, especially on 3D physically simulated environments. TimeChamber provides a self-play framework that can achieve fast training and evaluation with ONLY ONE GPU.
